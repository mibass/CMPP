A few examples of Neural Networks in Python and/or Tensorflow.

Neural Net 0.ipynb:
A simple example of a feedforward neural network trained to partially learn a logic table. This relies on the NeuralNetworkDrawer.py script to make graphical depictions of the network.

Tensorflow Track vs Shower Example.ipynb:
Classification example using a set of images produced by a simple MC to mimic the features of tracks and electromagnetic showers in a detector. Use the CNNDataGen.ipynb to generate the necessary images and labels training and testing datasets.
