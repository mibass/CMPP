# Computation Methods for Particle Physicists
Notebooks and examples for Computational Methods in Particle Physics

These are the notebooks that go along with a series of lectures I developed to introduce Particle Physicists to computational methods they will likely find useful in their research careers.

There are four lectures (with links to the slides and associated notebooks noted):

1. [Introductory Lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pZt32HfbtLkdGUcDT-2F04xz_x_ReHFKaeVP1vVDvyM/edit?usp=sharing)
